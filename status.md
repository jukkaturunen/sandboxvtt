- [x] Create `images` table (id, sandbox_id, name, file_path, is_active, created_at)
- [x] Create `tokens` table (id, sandbox_id, image_id, name, color, position_x, position_y, created_at)
- [x] Create `chat_messages` table (id, sandbox_id, sender_name, sender_role, message, created_at)
- [x] Write database initialization script

#### 1.2 File Storage Setup
- [x] Create uploads directory structure

- [x] Configure file upload limits (10MB)
- [x] Set up static file serving

#### 1.3 Basic API Endpoints
- [x] POST `/api/sandbox` - Create new sandbox
- [x] GET `/api/sandbox/:id` - Get sandbox data
- [x] POST `/api/sandbox/:id/image` - Upload image
- [x] GET `/api/sandbox/:id/images` - Get all images
- [x] PUT `/api/sandbox/:id/image/:imageId/activate` - Set active image
- [x] GET `/api/sandbox/:id/tokens` - Get all tokens
- [x] POST `/api/sandbox/:id/token` - Create token
- [x] PUT `/api/sandbox/:id/token/:tokenId` - Update token position
- [x] DELETE `/api/sandbox/:id/token/:tokenId` - Delete token
- [x] GET `/api/sandbox/:id/messages` - Get chat history
- [x] POST `/api/sandbox/:id/message` - Create message

### Previous Phase (Phase 0) - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

#### 0.1 Initialize Project
- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Initialize Node.js project (`package.json`)
- [x] Set up Git repository
- [x] Create `.gitignore` file

#### 0.2 Choose & Install Tech Stack
- [x] Select frontend framework (React + Vite)
- [x] Select backend framework (Express.js)
- [x] Select database (SQLite)
- [x] Select real-time library (Socket.io)
- [x] Install dependencies

#### 0.3 Project Structure
- [x] Create client directory structure
- [x] Create server directory structure
- [x] Set up build configuration (Vite)
- [x] Configure development hot-reload (nodemon + concurrently)

### Current Phase Tasks

Phase 5-11 will be implemented next. The core infrastructure is now complete!

### Current Status
Phase 4 complete! Sandbox view with complete layout, character naming modal, and WebSocket integration. Connection status displayed in real-time. GM panel visible only to GM, players get character name modal. Ready for Phase 5 - Image Management.

## Technology Stack Decisions

| Component | Choice | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Frontend Framework | React 19 | Most popular, great ecosystem |
| Backend Framework | Express 5 | Simple, flexible, well-documented |
| Database | SQLite (better-sqlite3) | Simple setup, no external dependencies |
| WebSocket Library | Socket.io | Easy to use, handles reconnection |
| Build Tool | Vite | Fast, modern, great DX |
| Canvas Library | Konva + React-Konva | Simplifies canvas interactions |
