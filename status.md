## Technology Stack Decisions

| Component | Choice | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Frontend Framework | React 19 | Most popular, great ecosystem |
| Backend Framework | Express 5 | Simple, flexible, well-documented |
| Database | SQLite (better-sqlite3) | Simple setup, no external dependencies |
| WebSocket Library | Socket.io | Easy to use, handles reconnection |
| Build Tool | Vite | Fast, modern, great DX |
| Canvas Library | Konva + React-Konva | Simplifies canvas interactions |
