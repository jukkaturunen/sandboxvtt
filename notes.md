I want to give the active image as much space as possible. I want to make side panels collapsible. Make Collapse arrows for both and place them inside canvas header, at the ends of it. When clicked it will hide the respective side's panel, and when clicked again makes the panel visible. When panel collapses, the canvas and canvas header should fill up the space. Also this way the collapse arrows stay in a visually correct place.
Also make sure that the visible panel (if any) maintains it's width when other panel changes visibility.
